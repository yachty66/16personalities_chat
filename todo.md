- get all top celebrities and top characters ie name and mbti type 
- in the next step get wikipedia page for each of them (drop them if they do not have a wiki page)

- want to take top characters and celebrities from https://www.personality-database.com/profile?pid=2&cid=27 
but before i add directly dozens of characters i add two and then based on that i scale them up
